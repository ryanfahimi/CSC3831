        "My analysis of the housing dataset revealed important discoveries about outlier detection and data imputation. I found statistical methods offered significant advantages in outlier detection despite their simplicity. The robust z-score method was particularly effective. Its use of median and MAD made it especially appropriate for my skewed housing data [1]. However, it did show some weakness with my bimodal geographic features.\n",

        "While algorithmic methods like LOF, SVM, and Isolation Forest could theoretically capture more complex patterns, they presented several practical challenges. LOF struggled with high-density regions, SVM showed problematic strip patterns, and Isolation Forest was generally oversensitive to outliers. These methods also required careful parameter tuning and significant computational resources, making them less practical for my particular dataset [4].\n",

        "For imputation, both KNN and MICE showed distinct strengths and weaknesses. KNN imputation proved more intuitive to implement and better performed regression. However, it struggled to maintain the center and skew of my features. MICE was more complex to implement and computationally intensive. However, it better preserved the center and skew of my distributions and performed regression almost as well as KNN. Its main drawback was poorer preservation of spread values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Several challenges emerged during implementation. For outlier detection, I struggled with handling different distribution types among my features. Imputation challenged me with feature selection and parameter tuning, particularly in balancing computational efficiency with accuracy. The visualization and comparison of results across multiple methods also proved difficult."
