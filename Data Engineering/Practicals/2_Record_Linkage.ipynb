For this practical please read the information in the text blocks, run the code blocks in sequence, and attempt the optional challenges if you have time.\n","\n","In this part of the course we will use a few Python packages. The packages used are as follows:\n","- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): Data manipulation and analysis tool\n","- [RecordLinkage](https://recordlinkage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): A python Record Linkage toolset\n","- [FuzzyMatcher](https://github.com/RobinL/fuzzymatcher): Legacy record linkage tool, no longer supported\n","- [MissingNo](https://github.com/ResidentMario/missingno): Graphical tool for easily visualising missing data\n","- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/): Numerical computing tool\n","-\n","\n","Additonally we will be playing around with some more Pandas DataFrame manipulations. Not every method is explained in detail, so if you are interested or want to know more please look at the Pandas method documentation.\n","\n","The data we will be using today are `hospital_accounts` which contains account information for various hospitals in the USA, and `hospital_reimbursement` which contains reimbursement financial data for various hospitals in the USA.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hZLPhaaH34cx"},"source":["# Record Linkage"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tLXhoGOB5KHc"},"source":["Firstly let's install the matching
